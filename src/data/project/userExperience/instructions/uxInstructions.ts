      long: `User experience is crucial for human-centric data spaces to keep things usable and accessible. The users need to understand what is expected of them, what is possible and to be an active part of the journey. Also, as the landscape of rapid innovation with surrounding complexities is present, UX creates understandable and usable front stage for users. <br /> <br />
        One big challenge is that user experience is very universal, and it is hard to pinpoint what is specific in Skills Data Space. The approach used in this work is to address things in general and show concrete examples within the Data Space context. User experience in Skills data space emphasizes clear and trustworthy interfaces, ensuring user control over their data. This work paves the way for human-centric data spaces keeping focus on accessibility and trust.  To get practical, examples of Matilda’s journey in EU-DUNE use case have been created to demonstrate actual user experience scenarios.

      long: "Beyond accessibility and trust, the additional user experience factors can be grouped into three main themes. The first theme revolves around user perception and satisfaction, encompassing perceived usefulness, continuity, empowerment, and quality of life. The second theme emphasizes consistency and adaptability, including factors like ubiquitous availability, context, and language localization. The final theme addresses technical and ethical aspects, covering implementation technology, reliability, avoiding deceptive patterns, and the need for quick evolution to meet evolving user needs. Together, these elements harmonize Matilda’s journey and create an immersive and engaging user experience within the Skills Data Space.",
